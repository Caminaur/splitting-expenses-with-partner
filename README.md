Splitting Expenses With Partner

The idea is that if partner 1 has X salary and partner 2 has Y salary
The division of the payment should be equivalent to an equal percentage of both salaries
For example
Person 1 salary 2000
Person 2 salary 1000
cost of living 1500

In this situation each person should pay 50% of their salaries 1000 and 500
